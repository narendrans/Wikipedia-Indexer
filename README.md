Information retrieval project at UB. 

This project contains code used for the Information Retrival project in University at Buffalo.

This project aims to build a Wikipedia indexer with the following goals:
• Parse fairly involved Wikipedia markup.
• Index a decent sized subset of the Wikipedia corpus.
• Create multiple indexes on the page data as well as metadata.
• Provide an index introspection mechanism that can later be built upon to support queries.

Steps to clone the project in Eclipse:

1. Install the Githb plugin for eclipse.
2. Change the view to git repository exploring.
3. Use the option, clone a git repository and add the clone to this view.
