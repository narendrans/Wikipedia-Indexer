'''Russ Conway''' (2 September 1925 – 16 November 2000) was a British [[popular music]] [[pianist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Career==
Conway was born '''Trevor Herbert Stanford''' in [[Bristol]] England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;&gt;Larkin C 'Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music' (Muze UK Ltd, 1997) ISBN 0-7535-0149-X p125&lt;/ref&gt; He won a scholarship to [[Bristol Cathedral Choir School]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; and was largely self-taught on piano as he whiled away hours as a youngster during a three-year term in borstal. His father then let him join the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. 

Conscripted into the [[Royal Navy]] in 1942, he served in the Merchant Navy from 1942 to 1948, and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medal]] as signalman in a minesweeping flotilla &quot;for distinguished service, efficiency and zeal&quot; in clearance of mines in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and operations during the relief of [[Greece]] 1944-45. During his Navy service, he lost the tip of the 3rd finger of his right hand while using a bread slicer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; He was discharged on health grounds because of a stomach ulcer.

Conway was talent-spotted while playing in a [[London]] [[nightclub|club]], signed to EMI's [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label and spent the mid-1950s providing backing for artists on their roster, including [[Gracie Fields]] and [[Joan Regan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; He recorded his first [[solo (music)|solo]] [[single (music)|single]] &quot;Party Pops&quot; in 1957, a &quot;medley of standard songs&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; which included &quot;Roll the Carpet Up&quot; and &quot;The Westminster Waltz&quot;.

Between 1957 and 1963, Conway had 20 U.K. chart hits, achieving a cumulative total of 83 weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1959 alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt;  This included two self-penned number one [[instrumental]]s, &quot;Side Saddle&quot; and &quot;Roulette&quot;, the latter deposing [[Elvis Presley]]'s &quot;[[A Fool Such As I]]&quot;. He was a fixture on light entertainment [[Television|TV]] shows and [[radio]] for many years afterwards, appearing at the [[London Palladium]] on a number of occasions&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; and becoming a regular on the [[Billy Cotton Band Show]] for several seasons. He also made recordings as a vocalist.

He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1959, when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] during a recording session at the BBC’s Studio 1 at 201 Piccadilly, London.

His career was blighted by ill health, including a nervous breakdown and subsequently a stroke, which prevented him from performing between 1968 and 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; He also at times drank heavily and smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day. He was prescribed anti-depressants and had periods of severe self-doubt. But he kept up playing. Having been diagnosed with stomach cancer in the late 1980s, in 1990 he founded the Russ Conway Cancer Fund with his friend, writer and [[Presenter|broadcaster]] Richard Hope-Hawkins, and they staged [[charitable organization|charity]] gala shows in major theatres that raised thousands of pounds for [[cancer]] charities.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

He appeared as himself in [[French and Saunders]]' 1994 Christmas special, playing &quot;I Like It&quot; in their spoof of ''[[The Piano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= 1994 Christmas Special|episodelink= |series= [[French and Saunders]]|serieslink= |credits= |network= [[Gold (TV channel)|Gold]]|station= |airdate= 24 April 2009|season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway, who never married, died on 16 November 2000.&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths NOV 2000 C48E 22 EASTBOURNE. DoB = 2 September 1925&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Hope-Hawkins delivered the main eulogy at Conway's [[funeral]] held at the historic [[St Mary Redcliffe|St Mary's Church]], [[Redcliffe, Bristol|Redcliffe]], Bristol. [[Elton John]] sent a wreath. In 2001 Hope-Hawkins devised, staged and directed a tribute to Conway at the [[Colston Hall]], Bristol, with an all-star cast. The £11,000 raised by the event was donated to St Peter's Hospice, Bristol.

'''Alan Louis Breeze''' (9 October 1909 – 15 January 1980) was an English [[singing|singer]] of the [[British dance band]] era and regular entertainer on the post-war [[BBC]] radio programme the [[Billy Cotton Band Show]].

He was born in [[West Ham]], [[London]], to Louis Breeze, a concert and oratorio singer and a member of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], and Isobel, who taught with the old [[London County Council]].

At the beginning of his career, Breeze sang in [[working men's club]]s, restaurants and even theatre queues. He produced some 78 recordings, for example from his later repertoire: &quot;[[I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts]]&quot;. He produced recordings at film studios for actors who could not sing. He met the band leader [[Billy Cotton]], who was to change his career forever.

Breeze started with Billy Cotton in 1932, without a contract, and stayed for 36 years. He became one of the most popular UK vocalists, on radio, television and in theatres around the United Kingdom. His [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] are still occasionally heard on the [[radio]].

Breeze died in January 1980 in [[Norwich]].

The '''Billy Cotton Band Show''' was a popular Sunday lunchtime radio programme on the [[BBC Light Programme]] from 1949 to 1968.

The [[band leader]], [[Billy Cotton]], was a larger-than-life [[Cockney]] character who started each show with the cry “Wakey-Wake-aaaay!”, followed by the band’s signature tune “[[Somebody Stole My Gal]]” (which was also featured in the video game [[Pop'n Music]] 9). 

The show transferred to [[BBC Television]] in 1956, usually on Saturday evenings at 7.00 pm. It ran, under various names, until 1965.
 
Regular entertainers included [[Alan Breeze]], [[Kathie Kay]], Doreen Stephens and the pianist [[Russ Conway]]. Pianist [[Mrs Mills]] made her first television appearance on the show.

[[Terry Jones]] and [[Michael Palin]], both later to become members of [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]], wrote jokes for the show.

'''William Edward Cotton''' (6 May 1899 – 25 March 1969), better known as '''Billy Cotton''', was an English [[band leader]] and [[entertainer]], one of the few whose orchestras survived the [[British dance band]] era. Now mainly remembered as a 1950s and 1960s [[radio]] and [[television]] personality, his musical career had begun in the 1920s. In his younger years Billy Cotton was also an amateur footballer for [[Brentford F.C.]] (and later, for the then Athenian league club Wimbledon, now [[AFC Wimbledon]]), an accomplished racing driver and the owner of a [[De Havilland Gipsy Moth|Gipsy Moth]] which he piloted himself. His autobiography entitled, I Did It My Way, was published in 1970, a year after his death.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Smith Square]], [[London]], to Joseph and Susan Cotton, Cotton was a choirboy and started his musical career as a [[drummer]]. He enlisted in the [[Royal Fusiliers]] by falsifying his age and saw service in [[World War I]] in [[Malta]] and [[Egypt]], before landing at [[Gallipoli]] in the middle of an artillery barrage. Later he was recommended for a commission and learned to fly [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighter]] aircraft. He flew solo for the first time in 1918, the same day the [[Royal Flying Corps]] became the [[Royal Air Force]]. He was then not yet 19 years old. In the early inter-war years. he had several jobs such as bus driver before setting up his own orchestra, the London Savannah Band, in 1924.

At first a straight dance band, over the years the London Savannah Band more and more tended towards [[music hall]]/[[vaudeville]] entertainment, introducing all sorts of visual and verbal humour in between songs. Famous musicians that played in Billy Cotton's band during the 1920s and 1930s included [[Arthur Rosebery]], Syd Lipton and [[Nat Gonella]]. The band was also noted for their [[African American]] trombonist and [[tap dance]]r, Ellis Jackson. Their signature tune was &quot;[[Somebody Stole My Gal]]&quot;, and they made numerous commercial recordings for [[Decca Records|Decca]].

During the [[Second World War]] Cotton and his band toured [[France]] with the [[Entertainments National Service Association]] ([[ENSA]]). After the war, he started his successful Sunday lunchtime radio show on [[BBC]], the ''[[Billy Cotton Band Show]]'', which ran from 1949 to 1968. In the 1950s composer [[Lionel Bart]] contributed comedy songs to the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queens-theatre.co.uk/biographies/lionelbart.htm Queens Theatre website - Lionel Bart profile]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It regularly opened with the band's signature tune and Cotton's call of &quot;Wakey Wakey&quot;. From 1957, it was also broadcast on BBC television.

As a racing driver his finest moment came in 1949 when he finished fourth in the [[1949 British Grand Prix]], sharing an [[English Racing Automobiles|ERA]] with [[David Hampshire]].

Cotton married Mabel E. Gregory in 1921 and they had two sons, Ted and [[Bill Cotton|Sir Bill Cotton]], who later became the BBC's managing director of television. In 1962 Billy Cotton suffered a [[stroke]]. He died in 1969 while watching a boxing match at [[Wembley Arena|Wembley]].

He was the great-uncle of TV &amp; Radio Presenter [[Fearne Cotton]].
